# 朱文藝的收藏館

A personal library curated by a citizen living in Taipei

<br>

從有記憶以來，我就是個讀書狂：歷史、文學、設計、科學、商業 ...，無所不讀。我很喜歡紙本書裡靜止完備的特性，所以儘管網路帶來了豐富且非常即時的資訊，我還是改不掉買書的習慣。

隨著使用網路的時間越來越多，資訊的演變越快，我發現要持有敏銳的觀察與持續的專注能力變得非常困難。所以我打造了這裡。

這裡是收藏館，是溫習的自修室，是孕育靈感的溫室，也是焦慮疲憊靈魂的休憩之地。

As far as I can remember, I've been a readaholic: history, literature, design, science, phycology ... I can read everything. Though Internet has brought us rich and fast information, I still like the properties of static and thoroughness in books, thus I still can't get rid of the habit of buying books.

As I use Internet more, I see information change faster and faster, it's getting really hard to keep sharp observation and long-term focus. Therefore I build this.

This is a library, a study room for myself, a greenhouse to harbor ideas, and also a place for an anxious, fatigued soul.
