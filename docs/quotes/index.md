### Charlie Munger

\- "I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don't have any real knowledge."

\- "It's not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid."

\- "All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there."

\- "Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance."

### Ben Franklin

\- "If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason."
